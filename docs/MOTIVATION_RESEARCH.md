# Motivation & UX Research Summary

## Charts and "This week so far"

- **Progress bars** (bar-based) are more effective than circular/ring charts for conveying progress: faster to read, lower cognitive load, and better alignment with how people judge proportion and change (*Semantic Scholar, IGI Global, PubMed*).
- **Line/area charts** are good for showing trend over time (e.g. checks per day); pairing a **clear progress bar** (e.g. X% of weekly goal) with the line chart gives both "how much" and "how each day went."
- **Encouraging microcopy** that reacts to performance (e.g. "Great week!", "Almost there!") and **praise-based messaging** (celebrating completions rather than just stating facts) improve engagement and behavior change (*Google Design – Fabulous app; APA – automated praise*).
- **Streaks** and visual celebration of consistency are highly rated in habit apps (*Curb health research*).

## App themes and motivation

- **Emerald green** fits wellness apps: renewal, calm, health, and new beginnings without overstimulation (*UXmatters, Adobe, color psychology*).
- **Gamification**: Badges, streaks, and small celebrations for milestones increase motivation (*WW challenges, MeAgain, WayBetter*).
- **Positive reinforcement**: Notifications and in-app copy that **praise** the user for completing actions perform better than copy that only explains value (*APA field experiment*).
- **Self-affirmation** and personalized, encouraging messaging support long-term adherence (*JMIR mHealth*).

## Suggestions applied in the app

1. **This week so far**: Prominent progress bar + line chart; dynamic encouraging message based on % (e.g. "You're on track!", "Great week so far!", "Perfect week! 🎉").
2. **Dashboard tone**: Warmer card titles and short motivational line where it fits.
3. **Weight**: Encouraging line when weight is down (e.g. "Trending in the right direction!").
4. **Milestones**: Clear "Achieved" styling; optional warm accent (e.g. amber/gold) for wins.
5. **Streaks**: More prominent when present; copy like "You're building momentum!"
6. **Theme**: Keep emerald as primary; use a warm accent sparingly for achievements.
